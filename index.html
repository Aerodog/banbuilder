        <h3>BOO Censorship!</h3>
		<p>I hate censorship as much as anyone, but as a web application developer, 
		there are times when a banned-word list is necessary, especially if the 
		application or site is geared towards younger users or corporate environments.</p>
		
		<p>In the repo, over 800 naughty words are available in the following formats: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>SQL</li>
			<li>PHP Array</li>
			<li>CSV</li>
			<li>LaTex</li>
			<li>YML</li>
			<li>XML</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to Get It?</h3>
		<p>Just click on the tar.gz or .zip icons above to download the files. Or 
		if you prefer, you can clone the repo: </p>
		
		<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:snipe/banbuilder.git</code></pre>
		
		<h3>Warning, Not For All Audiences, Blah Blah Blah...</h3>
		<p>There are over 800 words in the database so far. It should probably 
		go without saying that this content is NOT SAFE FOR WORK and is 
		NOT appropriate for children or anyone who is easily offended by words.</p>

		<p>And not to overstate the obvious, but no banned-word list is going to be 
		flawless. A G-rated list will block out the word "screw", but there are certainly 
		legitimate uses for the word "screw". Also, the word "dick" might be banned, but many 
		men named Richard are called "Dick" as their nickname. You may need to edit your 
		list to suit your needs, removing some words from the banned-word list that you 
		feel are too restrictive.</p>


		
		<h3>About This Project</h3>
		<p>On the forums I run, I tend to be fairly lenient on what my users can get 
		away with, blocking only the most offensive and racist terms. This project 
		started after I was forced to create and review yet another banned word list, 
		this time for a client project targeted towards young adults. The banlist 
		needed to be locked down pretty tight, which meant that my standard list of 
		banned words wouldn't even come close to fitting the bill. </p>
		
		<p>As I was putting this list together, I reached out to my filthy-mouthed 
		friends to gather words for the ban list. It occurred to me that collectively, 
		we could accomplish a lot more.</p>
		
		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm just a nerd that occasionally comes up with 
		fun projects that hopefully provide useful tools to other people out in 
		the ether. If you're interested, <a href="http://www.snipe.net">drop by my website</a> or ping me on the Twitters 
		at <a href="http://twitter.com/snipeyhead">@snipeyhead</a>.</p>
