        <h3>Why censorship?</h3>
		<p>I hate censorship as much as anyone, but as a web application developer, 
		there are times when a banned-word list is necessary, especially if the 
		application or site is geared towards younger users or corporate environments.</p>
		
		<h3>Why reinvent the wheel?</h3>
		<p>Although many of us have had a banned-word list of our own that we've been 
		curating over the years, one banned-word list might not meet the needs of every 
		application. A game for pre-teens might have different banlist requirements than 
		one for adults.</p>
		
		<p>BanBuilder is designed to allow you to customize your banned-words list, and is 
		constantly evolving. As people find new ways around the banned words 
		(using symbols instead of letters, for example), they get added. </p>



<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm just a web developer/php programmer that occasionally comes up with 
fun projects that hopefully provide useful tools to other people out in 
the cloud. If you're interested, drop by my website or follow me on Twitter.
