        <h3>BOO Censorship!</h3>
		<p>I hate censorship as much as anyone, but as a web application developer, 
		there are times when a banned-word list is necessary, especially if the 
		application or site is geared towards younger users or corporate environments.</p>
		
		<p>In the repo, over 800 naughty words are available in the following formats: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>SQL</li>
			<li>PHP Array</li>
			<li>CSV</li>
			<li>LaTex</li>
			<li>YML</li>
			<li>XML</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to Get It?</h3>
		<p>Just click on the tar.gz or .zip icons above to download the files. Or 
		if you prefer, you can clone the repo: </p>
		
		<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:snipe/banbuilder.git</code></pre>
		
		

		<h3>Simple Function</h3>
		<p>If the script you're implementing this on has regex capabilities, you're in luck. 
		Your job will be a lot easier, and your wordlist will be a lot shorter, since you 
		don't need to match on entire words only (and therefore account for every possibility 
		of that bad word showing up in a compound word), and we can handle case-sensitivity with ease. 
		In fact, you can ignore 90% of the database included 
		in this project, and use something like the following: </p>
		
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/4569410.js"></script>
		
		<h3>What This Script Does</h3>
		<p>The script above (also included in the test-cli.php file in the downloadable package) will take a 
		word or phrase and replace the words you put in the $badwords array and replace it with asterisks. 
		One asterisk for each letter of the word that's being replaced. 
		So &quot;shit&quot; turns into &quot;****&quot;, &quot;shitty&quot; turns into &quot;****ty&quot;, 
		etc. This script will honor the original case of the word being cleaned, and it is case-insensitive, 
		so it will not be tricked by MiXeD CaSE words.</p>
		
		<h3>What This Script Doesn't Do</h3>
		<p>Profanity filtering is actually pretty difficult, 
		if you want to do it REALLY right, since context is everything. 
		The word &quot;Dick&quot; can be a crude reference to male genitalia, or to the 
		nickname of a fellow named Richard. Context is the only way to tell the difference. 
		This database and PHP script isn't going to be able to determine context. </p>
		<p>If you put &quot;ass&quot; in your bad word array, legitimate words like 
		&quot;class&quot; will be turned into &quot;cl***&quot;, so choose your words wisely.</p>
		
		<h3>Warning, Not For All Audiences, Blah Blah Blah...</h3>
		<p>There are over 800 words in the database so far. It should probably 
		go without saying that this content is NOT SAFE FOR WORK and is 
		NOT appropriate for children or anyone who is easily offended by words.</p>

		<p>And not to overstate the obvious, but no banned-word list is going to be 
		flawless. A G-rated list will block out the word "screw", but there are certainly 
		legitimate uses for the word "screw". Also, the word "dick" might be banned, but many 
		men named Richard are called "Dick" as their nickname. You may need to edit your 
		list to suit your needs, removing some words from the banned-word list that you 
		feel are too restrictive.</p>

		
		<h3>About This Project</h3>
		<p>On the forums I run, I tend to be fairly lenient on what my users can get 
		away with, blocking only the most offensive and racist terms. This project 
		started after I was forced to create and review yet another banned word list, 
		this time for a client project targeted towards young adults. The banlist 
		needed to be locked down pretty tight, which meant that my standard list of 
		banned words wouldn't even come close to fitting the bill. </p>
		
		
		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm just a nerd that occasionally comes up with 
		fun projects that hopefully provide useful tools to other people out in 
		the ether. If you're interested, <a href="http://www.snipe.net">drop by my website</a> or ping me on the Twitters
